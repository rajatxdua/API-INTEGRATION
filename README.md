A comprehensive, responsive news web application that demonstrates real-world API integration using modern web development technologies. This project showcases the ability to fetch, process, and display real-time news data from multiple sources while maintaining exceptional user experience across all devices.

Khabari (meaning "news" in Hindi/Urdu) is more than just a news aggregator - it's a demonstration of advanced frontend development skills, API orchestration, error handling, and responsive design principles. The application intelligently manages multiple data sources, implements fallback mechanisms, and provides a seamless user experience regardless of network conditions or API availability.
